                    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
                    bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
                    the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
                    conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
                    “without pictures or conversations?”
                    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
                    hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
                    making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
                    picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
                    close by her. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
                    plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
                    was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
                    what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
                    looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
                    cupboards and book-shelves; here and

                    hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
                    passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great
                    disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
                    of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
                    cupboards as she fell past it. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had

          There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
          so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
          dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
          it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
          time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
          watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
          on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
          had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
          watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
          field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
          large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
